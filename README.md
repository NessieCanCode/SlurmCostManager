# SlurmCostManager

**SlurmCostManager** is a Cockpit plugin that integrates seamlessly into the Cockpit UI on Linux servers. It provides interactive billing analytics and invoice management for HPC environments using **Slurm** and SlurmDBD.

This repository now includes a responsive Cockpit UI built with React.  The interface loads mock billing data from `mock-billing.json` using Cockpit APIs and offers summary, detail and invoice views with a built‑in PDF viewer.

## ✅ Features

- **Monthly billing summaries** displayed right in Cockpit’s navigation menu.
- **Invoice dashboards** to view, download, and archive invoice PDFs.
- **Detailed cost drill-downs** (core‑hours, instance‑hours, GB‑month) for per‑account transparency.
- **Historical billing data** accessible from account inception for auditing and trend analysis.
- **Organization-wide views** consolidating charges across all member Slurm accounts.

## 🧰 Installation & Development

Recommend using the **Cockpit Starter Kit** workflow to scaffold and build your plugin:

- Use `make devel-install` to symlink your dist output into `~/.local/share/cockpit/` for live development.  
- Run `make build` or `make` to compile and prepare for release.  
- Use `make check` to run integration tests via Cockpit's VM-based test system.
Cockpit’s `manifest.json` registers your tool under the main menu. Your UI files will live in `src/`, built via webpack into `dist/`.

## 🌐 Usage

1. On a Linux host with **Cockpit** installed (e.g. CentOS, Fedora, Debian compatible).
2. After `make devel-install`, open your browser to `https://<host>:9090`.
3. Locate **SlurmCostManager** in the sidebar menu.
4. Interact with billing summaries, drill-ins, and invoice retrieval directly within Cockpit.

## 📝 Development Notes

- Your UI components can access system files or commands using `cockpit.file()` and other Cockpit APIs.
- Write integration tests using the Python-based browser automation tools bundled with Cockpit Starter Kit.
- Ensure cross‑OS compatibility by leveraging Cockpit’s built-in CI and test VM infrastructure.
